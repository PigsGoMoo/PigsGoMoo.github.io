    <h1>Changelogs:</h1>
    <h3>Each bullet point represents a commit ordered from most recent</h3>
    <p>
      This is mainly for me to figure out which commit to revert to if
      everything breaks without having to open up my GitHub or scroll through
      the mess of logs again..
    </p>
    <!-- It's a shame I can't just code it to grab straight from Github-->
    <ul>
      <li>Added changelogs - 98292c48f0b318129e6f3a4ae2cc3965ded3f7c0</li>
      <li>
        Fixed a few small bugs when buying producers or increasing your CPS in
        general during the boost. Numbers should be correct now. -
        d13c8f1f02766db00df107207ca70299e7d25f6e
      </li>
      <li>
        Added a transition from dark to light green for the special boost
        cooldown. Still need to figure out how to show how long is left. -
        4dead558cdaa47c35f39a5fd1a325f316b12f513
      </li>
      <li>
        Added basic functionality to caffeine boost. Specs still passing. Still
        need to figure out cd UI - e821871d171d3d6d869401c49c39ca54dd1bd282
      </li>
      <li>
        Added UI for new feature: Caffeine boost -
        51b29056383aa8dda9dfe400f9a2a39163d173df
      </li>
      <li>
        Cleaned up code. Can't fully DRY all the code with UpdateUI() yet
        because will fail test specs (test specs don't have clickData
        innerText). - 8b04e438cf55e5e8faf1b507eeae8890c262cce0
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed a bug in loading clickData. Specs still passing -
        f2af9f49493657061cec5d43530b01616d704dc5
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed reset deny button. - fff49433764d714d56f778d61f65c48085b3056b
      </li>
      <li>
        Added confirmation message for reset game button. Not entirely sure why
        denying still calls the resart game, even though literally nothing
        points to it.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed a save/load bug - c9f338dd15eab48112b3694cc279403c3ba1ca7c</li>
      <li>
        Added UI to save game button - 44966d09d83a3b7626becf8826d046b135fa3b16
      </li>
      <li>
        Merged branch with master - f4ba24d2d4d334fd20c9c914c631937532c24f43
      </li>
      <li>Fixed a small bug with the UI update function</li>
      <li>
        I DID IT! IT WORKS. Added producer upgrades. All specs passed still
      </li>
      <li>
        Added an if statement in the renderProducers function to append the
        upgrades if unlocked. Haven't made a way to unlock any upgrades yet, so
        specs still passing.
      </li>
      <li>Forgot a line. Specs still pass.</li>
      <li>
        I think I got it. Haven't implemented calling the function yet, so specs
        still pass. Saving before everything goes wrong...
      </li>
      <li>
        Figured out a possible way to add the upgrade div properly. Added an id
        tag to each of the created producer class boxes. Specs still passing
      </li>
      <li>
        Starting to make the producer upgrade divs. Saving before I break
        anything. All specs still passing
      </li>
      <li>Updated comment navigation</li>
      <li>
        I think I figured out how to readd the producer upgrades. The problem
        before was that I added and showed it as soon as producers was
        available, which the testspecs didn't like because each producer box had
        too many children. Now if I unlock it as you get a specific amount of
        money, it should work...
      </li>
      <li>
        Readded my producer upgrade info from main branch. Let's see if I can
        readd this feature without breaking specs this time...
      </li>
      <li>Added click upgrades</li>
      <li>Possible fix for upgradeClicks specs</li>
      <li>
        Fixed a small UI bug where loading up a new page doesn't fully update
        the UI
      </li>
      <li>Added click upgrades. Game even less balanced now</li>
      <li>
        Added styling, seling, and save game features! And a reset game button!
      </li>
      <li id="before_extras">
        Everything before this point is the basic game for passing specs with no
        extra features. - 2b3ab352ae163dc4ce801ce28d4129585a8175a7
